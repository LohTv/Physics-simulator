Our Goal:

Our goal is to make a physics simulator, for studying physics with joy and providing a visual intuition for physics laws.

Description:

We will have a 2D physics simulator that will be able to model physics laws from those branches of physics:
Kinematics: Motion of objects, displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
Dynamics: Forces and Newton’s laws of motion, and also basic fluid mechanics.
Thermodynamics: Heat, energy, and the behavior of gases.
Gravitational Interactions: Effects of gravity between objects.
Electromagnetic Interactions: Electric fields, magnetic fields, and their interactions.
*Basic Optics: Light, reflection, refraction, and lenses.
*Basic Chemistry: Elementary reactions and molecular interactions.
*Basic Nuclear Physics: Concepts such as radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.
*Basic Relativistic Physics (optional): Time dilation, length contraction, and other effects predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity.

The simulator will also contain presets of experiments with explanations created to demonstrate laws of physics.

Features and functionality:

Interactive experiments: Experiments will be interactive, users will be able to adjust their values for physics quantities, such as mass, friction, velocity and so on, to see how those quantities affect the outcome of the experiment. 
Data visualization: During simulation, the program will track data and use it to create a graph or diagram to visualize it, such as velocity vs time graph, position vs time graph and so on. Also the program will visualize vectors of forces, motion and so on. These visualizations will help to better understand the physical system.
Custom Experiments(Sandbox mode): In addition to preset experiments, the simulator will allow users to create their own experiments by selecting objects, forces, and physical parameters.This will allow users to play with physical laws on their own, forcing creativity and thinking. Those experiments can be saved to repeat them later.
Interactive physics problems: The program will include physics problems and challenges, where students will have to use their physics knowledge to get needed outcomes to the experiments. Those challenges will have different difficulties varying from easy to hard.

Problem analysis:

We will use programming language python, as it is easy to use, we will also use python library ‘pymunk’ specialy designed to simulate physics in python. 

Limitations:
As project uses high level language(python) starting big and complex simulation could run slow. Apart from the limitations of a programming language and library that we use(pymunk), project have theoretically no limitations, because it is only limited by our knowledge and skills of programming.
